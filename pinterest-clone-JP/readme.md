### Build a Pinterest Clone

> [Source FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/#take-home-projects).
> This project is a challenge posed by FreeCodeCamp, created with as few frameworks as possible. The challenge is to create a Pinterest clone where the user can log in with their github account and then users can view, link, and delete images that they link to on the Pinterest clone.

**Objective:** Build a [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) app that is functionally similar to this: https://build-a-pinterest-clone.freecodecamp.rocks/.

#### Project's User Stories

1. **User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub.

2. **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

3. **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.

4. **User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.

5. **User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

6. **User Story:** As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

**Hint:** [Masonry.js](https://masonry.desandro.com/) is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
